# WEB_SCRAPPING
A **web scraper** is a tool that automatically extracts data from websites by fetching HTML content and parsing it for specific information. It's commonly used for data collection, price monitoring, and competitive analysis. However, it must be done ethically and in compliance with website terms and laws.
